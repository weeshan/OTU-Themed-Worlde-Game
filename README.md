# OTU-Themed-Worlde-Game

1. Objectives:
● Engaging and Relatable Wordplay: Our goal is to design a fun and interactive word-based game
inspired by Ontario Tech University. This game will feature difficulty modes such as Classic, Hardcore,
and Blitz to cater to players of varying skill levels. This ensures that our game is exciting as well as
engaging for everyone.
● User-Interface: Design a visually appealing Ontario Tech-themed interface to make the game relatable
and give it a personal touch that resonates with OTU students.
● Secure Login System: We aim to implement a PHP-based login system that allows players to create their
own profiles. This feature will securely save their game progress, enabling them to pick up right where
they left off whenever they return.
● Applying Learned Concepts to Practice: We aim to bring together key concepts from the course,
including JavaScript logic, HTML forms, CSS styling, responsive media queries, database management
and connection, and localStorage. By integrating these theoretical concepts into practice, we strive to
deliver a fully functional and visually appealing web-based game that not only highlights our technical
skills but also provides a clear understanding of the knowledge that we've gained.
